Sample code from Aaron Parecki's presentation on geolocatoin in web and mobile apps.


Firefox Geolocation
===================

If you're at a place where Firefox can't geo-locate you from the wifi, then try setting the geo.wifi.uri
parameter in about:config to point to the location.json file provided here. This will always return a
consistent location from the Javascript geolocation API methods.
